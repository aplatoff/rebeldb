# RebelDB‚Ñ¢

A new database engine is brewing üß™, imagine if REBOL and SQLite had a rebellious offspring ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Overview

RebelDB‚Ñ¢ is a high-performance database engine written in Zig that combines efficient memory management with flexible storage options. Key features:

- Variable-length integer encoding optimized for lexicographical ordering
- Flexible page-based storage system with configurable alignment
- Zero-copy value storage with efficient memory management
- Compile-time configuration for optimal performance

## Quick Start

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const Page = @import("page.zig").Page;
const ByteAligned = @import("page.zig").ByteAligned;
const Static = @import("page.zig").Static;
const Mutable = @import("page.zig").Mutable;

// Create a simple page with 128 bytes capacity
var data: [128]u8 = undefined;
const BasicPage = Page(u8, Static(128), ByteAligned(u8), Mutable(u8));
var page: *BasicPage = @ptrCast(&data);

// Initialize and store values
_ = page.init(128);
const val = page.alloc(16);
@memcpy(val, "Hello, RebelDB!");
```
